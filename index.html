      <h2>A little about me</h2>
      <p>I am a penultimate student majoring in 
        <a href="https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/prospective-students/undergraduate-programme/data-science-and-economics/">Data Science and Economics</a> 
          and minoring in 
          <a href="https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/">Entrepreneurship</a> 
          in NUS, expected to graduate in 2025! I have a keen interest in tech and the finance space. I believe that the application of data science techniques to drive rational decisions is becoming increasingly important amidst an increasingly noisy world where data is becoming more abundant. </p>
      <br>    
      <p>I am experienced in using R, Python, SQL, Java and the implementation of machine learning methods to extract insights and present them in a comprehensible yet aesthetic manner. </p>
