      <h2>A little about me</h2>
      <p>I'm passionate about all things data. Singaporean bachelors degree holder, majored in 
        <a href="https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/prospective-students/undergraduate-programme/data-science-and-economics/">Data Science and Economics</a> 
          and minored in 
          <a href="https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/">Entrepreneurship</a> 
          in NUS, graduated in 2025! I have a keen interest in working with <b>tech</b> and <b>data</b>. 
          I believe that the application of data science techniques to drive rational decisions is becoming increasingly important amidst an increasingly noisy world where data is becoming more abundant. 
          <br>In my free time, I love to learn, explore and try out new things! This led me to learn many new things online! Click

      <p>I am experienced in using <b>R, Python, SQL, Tableau<b> to implement machine learning methods to extract insights and present them in a simple yet detailed and aesthetic manner. </p>
