## Project Description
Our team FoodieX is developing a mobile-based application to help enable people to live a healthier lifestyle and reduce illness. 
Our solutions implements AI Image recognition technology to enable people to calculate food calories and ensure nutritional balance. FoodieX application will also automatically schedule the sports activities according to the foods taken. This solution will also track user activity progresses throughout a workout plan. Our solution will also notify users to drink water to ensure the body is well hydrated. Although FoodieX is similar to CalorieMama and HealthifyMe but our solution has a better automation system and AI system compared to the other solutions in the market which is highly effective and reduces the time spent in making yourself a diet plan. By using FoodieX, we can easily ensure our calories gain is normal and work out as planned to prevent illnesses such as obesity. Our team is made up of 2 Designers and 3 Programmers working collaboratively on this project. We will be building our project using Ionic and Cordova and Food image recognition API.

## Our rationale
Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, most of us are staying at home. This restriction has caused people to exercise less and eat more. This inspired us to create a solution which can helps everyone by controlling the calories with just using mobile phones. We have learned with proper motivation and all people can be healthier. We face challenges in keeping the fine line between creating [a UI that people will use, and a UI that is neither intuitive nor sustains its usage].
