## My Personal Website!

Credits to [Nikla Buschmann] (https://github.com/niklasbuschmann) for his [contrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) project which contributed immensely to the development of this site and my learning of what goes on behind each webpage!

## Contents

This site features some of my accomplishments, projects and WIPs.
It's something of a trophy trove for me which I update after certain project milestones which I like to keep logged in my personal private Notion page.
Hope you enjoy reading the site. See you around!
